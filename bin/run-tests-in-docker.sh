# Synopsis:
# Test the test runner Docker image by running it against a predefined set of 
# solutions with an expected output.
# The test runner Docker image is built automatically.

# Environment:
# SKIP_DOCKER_BUILD: if set, skip building the Docker image

# Output:
# Outputs the diff of the expected test results against the actual test results
# generated by the test runner Docker image.

# Example:
# ./bin/run-tests-in-docker.sh

# Stop executing when a command returns a non-zero return code
set -e

# Build the Docker image
if [ -z "${SKIP_DOCKER_BUILD}" ]; then
  docker build --rm -t exercism/arturo-test-runner .
else
  echo "Skipping docker build because SKIP_DOCKER_BUILD is set."
fi

# Run the Docker image using the settings mimicking the production environment
